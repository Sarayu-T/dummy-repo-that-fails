1. **Root Cause:** The error is a `ZeroDivisionError`, occurring in `src/main.py` within the `buggy_function`. This happens because the function attempts to divide 1 by 0, which is mathematically undefined.


2. **Specific Fix:**  Modify `src/main.py` as follows:

```python
def buggy_function(denominator=1):  # Provide a default denominator
    if denominator == 0:
        return 0  # Or another appropriate value like float('inf') or None, or raise a custom exception
    return 1 / denominator

buggy_function() # This now uses the default denominator and won't cause an error
```

3. **Explanation:**

This fix introduces a default value for the `denominator` parameter of `buggy_function`. Now, if the function is called without an argument, it will use the default value of 1, preventing the division by zero. If the function is *intentionally* called with a denominator of 0, this fix also handles that gracefully by returning 0.  You could also raise a ValueError or return `float('inf')` or `None` depending on the desired behavior in that specific case.  This makes the function more robust and prevents the `ZeroDivisionError`.

If `buggy_function` is intended to handle arbitrary denominators, including zero, and the current behavior of dividing by zero was not intentional,  then you need to decide on the *correct* way to handle a zero denominator:  return a special value (like 0, infinity, or None), or raise an exception to signal an invalid input.  The best approach depends entirely on the function's intended purpose.
